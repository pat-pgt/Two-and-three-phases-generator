This project is a very old project to generate, by multiple ways, 2 and 3 phases sinusoidal low frequency signals.

The analogue way is a little bit tricky to keep the amplitude, the frequency and the phase relations.
The digital way to generate square signals and to filter in order to get rid of the 3, 5, 7 etc... harmonics requires many high precision capacitors and resistor. 

The projects, here, generate an approximately sinusoidal signal to be filtered by only a basic second order S&K. The best compromise is to generate 3 bits signals.
* The last one but still old uses a big CPLD with many output pins.
  The code is written, using the VHDL language.
  It follows the 2010's good practices to always write as a 2 processes architectures (one combinatorial and one latch). This is intended to avoid accidental latches but make everything tricky, especially if latches are required!!
  There is a test to run it and view using a wav files viewer.
* Another one is an older 21 74HCxx circuit.
  The schema, a VHDL export and basic VHDL models are provided.
  There is a test file to run them and view using a wav files viewer.
